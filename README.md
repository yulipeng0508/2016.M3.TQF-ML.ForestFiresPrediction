The project is to predict whether there will be forest fires using several factors such as month of the year, day of the week, FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code) index, DMC (Duff Moisture Code) index, DC (Drought Code) index, ISI (Initial Spread) index, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, outside rain and so on.
